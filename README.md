## Overview
This project was an assignment for an algorithms course at Eastern Kentucky University, Spring 2019.

The assignment specification was to create a genetic program that could approximate a mathematical function given a 
list of 2 dimensional points. This project goes beyond the assignment requirements by using independent variables and 
their values and dependent values to work for multi-variable functions. The particular values for this assignment are
the following:

Independent variables:
```
X: [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
```

Dependent values:
```
0.0
0.005
0.020
0.045
0.080
0.125
0.180
0.245
0.320
0.405
```

The function we were trying to obtain was the following:
```
x^2 / 2
```

## Running
The program was run multiple times using various population sizes, generations, etc. The parameters used for
submission are included in the `values.json` file. These include a population size of `1000` and a max of `100` 
generations.

For the set of terminal symbols (tree leaves), the set of integers from -5 to 5 inclusive and the independent variables
were used. For functions (internal tree nodes), the set of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions
was used. The design of the program allows for new functions (of any number of parameters) to be added easily.

The probability of whether a terminal symbol or function will be selected when growing a tree and the max height a tree
can grow to can be altered in the `values.json` file.

## Results
Here are the top 3 functions obtained after running the program 10 times:

|            Equation             | Square Error         |
|:-------------------------------:|----------------------|
| `(x / 3)`                       | 0.024991666666666676 |
| `((-5 * x) / (-3 / (-1 / -5)))` | 0.024991666666666676 |
| `((-5 * x) / (-3 / (-1 / -5)))` | 0.024991666666666676 |

After leaving the program to run until an ideal function was generated, this function was generated after 11 runs:

|              Equation              | Square Error          |
|:----------------------------------:|-----------------------|
| `(((x / 2) * x) + ((-5 * 1) + 5))` | 4.057242261750142e-33 |

For this ideal function, the 10 values it obtains for the 10 `x-values` are as follows:

| X-value | Output |
|:-------:|:------:|
|   0.0   |   0.0  |
|   0.1   |  0.005 |
|   0.2   |  0.020 |
|   0.3   |  0.045 |
|   0.4   |  0.080 |
|   0.5   |  0.125 |
|   0.6   |  0.180 |
|   0.7   |  0.245 |
|   0.8   |  0.320 |
|   0.9   |  0.405 |
